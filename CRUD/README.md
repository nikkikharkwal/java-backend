# CRUD

 > A simple example of a CRUD application using Java, Spring, and a MySQL database:


    This code sets up a basic CRUD API using Spring Boot and JPA (Java Persistence API) to interact with a MySQL database. 
    You can test the API by sending HTTP requests using tools like curl or Postman.
