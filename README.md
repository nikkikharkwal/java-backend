## Getting Started

* Here are some things you can do while learning Java backend development:

   * Get familiar with Java fundamentals: Brush up your understanding of Java syntax, OOP concepts, collections, generics, and exceptions.

   * Learn about server-side Java frameworks: Familiarize yourself with popular Java frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

   * Study relational databases: Learn about relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle and understand how to interact with them using Java.

   * Learn RESTful web services: Study RESTful web services and understand how to build RESTful APIs using Java.

   * Practice, practice, practice: As with learning any new skill, practice is key. Build small projects that utilize the technologies and frameworks you are learning about.

   * Work on real-world projects: Try to contribute to open-source projects or take up freelance projects to gain hands-on experience in Java backend development.

   * Keep up to date with the latest trends: Java is a constantly evolving language and it's important to stay up to date with the latest trends and best practices. Read blogs and attend conferences and workshops to keep yourself updated.

### Prerequisites

+ [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/)
+ [IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)

### Installation

To install the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine, you can follow these steps:

1.Download the JDK: Go to the official [Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) and download the JDK for your operating system.

2. Install the JDK: Double-click the downloaded file to start the installation process. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

3. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable: Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the location where the JDK is installed. This is usually `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk<version>` on Windows, and `/usr/java/jdk<version>` on Linux.

4. Update the `PATH` environment variable: Add the `bin` directory of the JDK installation to your `PATH` environment variable. This will allow you to run the `java` and `javac` commands from the command line.

5. Verify the installation: Open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command to verify the installation: `java -version`. You should see the version of the JDK that is installed on your machine.

6. This should install the JDK on your machine, and you should be able to use it for developing Java applications.

## Usage

These projects will not only help you to solidify your understanding of Java backend development but also give you a portfolio to showcase your skills to potential employers.
